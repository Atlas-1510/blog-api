# blog-api

This is a RESTful API for my personal blog. The API uses the following technologies:

- [Expressjs](https://expressjs.com) for route handling.
- [Passportjs](http://www.passportjs.org) for user authentication, using both the username/password local strategy as well as JSON web tokens.
- [bcrypt.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) for user password hashing.
- [Express-validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/) for validation of articles and comments.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for database hosting.
- [Mongoosejs](https://mongoosejs.com) for easier integration with MongoDB.
